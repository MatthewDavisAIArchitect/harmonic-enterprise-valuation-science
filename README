# Harmonic Enterprise Valuation Science (HEVS)

HEVS is a non-operational, publication-grade framework for enterprise valuation. It is written to be governance-ready, canon-stable, and executive-readable.

## Volumes
- **Volume I — Ontology of Valuation**  
  Defines the foundational conditions under which valuation may exist as a coherent phenomenon.  
  See: `Volume_I/README.md` and `Volume_I/HEVS_Volume_I.pdf`

- **Volume II — Structure of Valuation**  
  Defines admissible forms, constraints, and structural invariance once ontological grounding is satisfied.  
  See: `Volume_II/README.md` and `Volume_II/HEVS_Volume_II.pdf`

- **Volume III — Harmonic Law of Valuation**  
  Defines the lawful principles, invariants, and impossibility boundaries governing valuation once ontology and structure are satisfied.  
  See: `Volume_III/README.md` and `Volume_III/HEVS_Volume_III.pdf`
