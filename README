# HEVS Trilogy — Volume I (Ontology of Valuation)

**Harmonic Enterprise Valuation Science (HEVS)** is a three-volume scientific treatise.  
This volume establishes the *ontological* altitude: the foundational conditions under which valuation may exist as a coherent phenomenon.

## What this volume is
- A **law-first** foundation for valuation as a scientific object (not a method, model, or practice).
- A **closed** ontological domain: axioms, invariants, and impossibility boundaries stated without reference to implementation or use.
- A **canonical ground** for Volumes II (Structure) and III (Harmonic Law).

## What this volume is not
- Not financial advice, valuation guidance, pricing instruction, or a measurement method.
- Not computational, procedural, or operational.
- Not a reconciliation layer for existing valuation schools or frameworks.

## How to read Volume I
Recommended order:
1. **Preface / Introduction / Scientific Positioning**
2. **Ontological Scope & Boundaries**
3. **Foundations** (identity + intrinsic significance)
4. **Ontological Canon** (axioms, invariance, impossibility boundary; SRVO-Prime)
5. **Back matter** (glossary, tables, diagrams, lineage, chronology)
6. **Final Declaration & Canon Lock**

## Canon and integrity
Volume I is written to stand alone and remain stable under reinterpretation pressure. It is the Trilogy’s **irreversible ground**; later volumes build upon it without revising its ontological commitments.
